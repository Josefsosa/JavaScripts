# JavaScript Notes
Big O notation 

A performance of the generated JavaScript code.

### It's important to have precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
### Useful for discussing 

* Motivate the need for something like Big O Notation
* Describe what Big O Notation is
* Simplify Big O Expressions
* Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
* Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation
* Describe what a logarithm is

### Example:
"Write a function that accepts a string input and returns a reversed copy"
